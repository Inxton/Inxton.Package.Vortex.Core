# Connector


This document describes basic concepts and core features of the Vortex Connector.




Vortex Connector provides basic classes that allow to access values of the PLC variables. Each base PLC type is represented by the respective wrapper of the connector class which is called Primitive Twin. Primitive twins allow for cyclic and synchronous read / write access of the PLC variables, shadow variables that can be used for batch write / read operations on complex objects.
